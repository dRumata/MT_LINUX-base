Let’s have sed print the first line of the file. Execute the following command:
```
sed -n '1p' BSD
```

```
Output
Copyright (c) The Regents of the University of California.
```

By placing the number 1 before the print command, you told sed the line number to operate on. You can just as easily print five lines (don’t forget the “-n”):
```
sed -n '1,5p' BSD
```
You’ll see this output:
```

```
You could have specified this in a different way by giving the first address and then using an offset to tell sed how many additional lines to travel, like this:
```
sed -n '1,+4p' BSD
```
If you want to print every other line, specify the interval after the ~ character. The following command prints every other line in the BSD file, starting with line 1:
```
sed -n '1~2p' BSD
```
Here’s the output you’ll see:
```

If we want to save our edits, we can redirect standard output to a file like so:
```
sed '1~2d' BSD > everyother.txt
```
Now open the file with cat:
```
cat everyother.txt
```
Using the -i switch will overwrite the original file, so you should use this with care.
Let’s try it by editing the everyother.txt file you just created, in-place. Let’s further reduce the file by deleting every other line again:
```
sed -i '1~2d' everyother.txt
```
To create a backup file prior to editing, add the backup extension directly after the “-i” option:
```
sed -i.bak '1~2d' everyother.txt
```
The s is the substitute command. The three slashes (/) are used to separate the different text fields. You can use other characters to delimit the fields if it would be more helpful.
Execute the following command to print a URL with echo and modify it with sed, using the underscore (_) character as the delimiter:
```
echo "http://www.example.com/index.html" | sed 's_com/index_org/home_'
```
This replaces com/index with org/home. The output shows the modifed URL:

Output
```
http://www.example.org/home.html
```
Do not forget the final delimiter, or sed will complain. If you ran this command:
```
echo "http://www.example.com/index.html" | sed 's_com/index_org/home'
```
You’d see this output:
```
Output
sed: -e expression #1, char 20: unterminated `s' command
```
Let’s create a new file to practice some substitutions. Execute the following command to create a new text file called song.txt:
```
echo "this is the song that never ends
yes, it goes on and on, my friend
some people started singing it
not knowing what it was
and they'll continue singing it forever
just because..." > song.txt
```
Выполните по-очереди три следующие комманды и сравните результаты:
```
sed 's/on/forward/' song.txt
```
```
sed 's/on/forward/g' song.txt
```
```
sed 's/on/forward/2' song.txt
```

You can then pass the p option to the substitute command to print lines where substitution took place.
```
sed -n 's/on/forward/2p' song.txt
```
Replacing and Referencing Matched Text
wildcard expression matches from the beginning of the line to the last instance of `at`.
```
sed 's/^.*at/REPLACED/' song.txt
```
you can use the & character to represent the matched text in the replacement string.
```
sed 's/^.*at/(&)/' song.txt
```
You’ll see this output:
```
Output
(this is the song that) never ends
yes, it goes on and on, my friend
some people started singing it
(not knowing what) it was
and they'll continue singing it forever
just because...
```

Every group of search text marked with parentheses can be referenced by an escaped reference number. For instance, the first parentheses group can be referenced with \1, the second with \2 and so on.

In this example, we’ll switch the first two words of each line:
```
sed 's/\([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*\) \([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*\)/\2 \1/' song.txt
```
You’ll see this output:
```
Output
is this the song that never ends
yes, goes it on and on, my friend
people some started singing it
knowing not what it was
they and'll continue singing it forever
because just...
```
As you can see, the results are not perfect. For instance, the second line skips the first word because it has a character not listed in our character set. Similarly, it treated they'll as two words in the fifth line.

Let’s improve the regular expression to be more accurate:
```
sed 's/\([^ ][^ ]*\) \([^ ][^ ]*\)/\2 \1/' song.txt
```
You’ll see this output:
```
Output
is this the song that never ends
it yes, goes on and on, my friend
people some started singing it
knowing not what it was
they'll and continue singing it forever
because... just
```
