Let’s use sed to view the contents of the BSD license file. sed sends its results to the screen by default, which means you can use it as a file reader by passing it no editing commands. Try executing the following command:
```
sed '' BSD
```
You’ll see the BSD license displayed to the screen:
```
Output

sed can use standard input rather than a file. Pipe the output of the cat command into sed to produce the same result:
```
cat BSD | sed ''
```
You’ll see the output of the file:

sed’s explicit print command, which you specify by using the p character within single quotes.

Execute the following command:
```
sed 'p' BSD
```
You’ll see each line of the BSD file printed twice:

You can clean up the results by passing the -n option to sed, which suppresses the automatic printing:
```
sed -n 'p' BSD
```

```

Addresses let you target specific parts of a text stream. You can specify a specific line or even a range of lines.

Let’s have sed print the first line of the file. Execute the following command:
```
sed -n '1p' BSD
```

```
Output
Copyright (c) The Regents of the University of California.
```

By placing the number 1 before the print command, you told sed the line number to operate on. You can just as easily print five lines (don’t forget the “-n”):
```
sed -n '1,5p' BSD
```
You’ll see this output:
```

```
You could have specified this in a different way by giving the first address and then using an offset to tell sed how many additional lines to travel, like this:
```
sed -n '1,+4p' BSD
```
If you want to print every other line, specify the interval after the ~ character. The following command prints every other line in the BSD file, starting with line 1:
```
sed -n '1~2p' BSD
```
Here’s the output you’ll see:
```

You can perform text deletion where you previously were specifying text printing by changing the p command to the d command.sed will print everything that is not deleted.

If we want to save our edits, we can redirect standard output to a file like so:
```
sed '1~2d' BSD > everyother.txt
```
Now open the file with cat:
```
cat everyother.txt
```
Using the -i switch will overwrite the original file, so you should use this with care.
Let’s try it by editing the everyother.txt file you just created, in-place. Let’s further reduce the file by deleting every other line again:
```
sed -i '1~2d' everyother.txt
```
To create a backup file prior to editing, add the backup extension directly after the “-i” option:
```
sed -i.bak '1~2d' everyother.txt
```
The s is the substitute command. The three slashes (/) are used to separate the different text fields. You can use other characters to delimit the fields if it would be more helpful.
Execute the following command to print a URL with echo and modify it with sed, using the underscore (_) character as the delimiter:
```
echo "http://www.example.com/index.html" | sed 's_com/index_org/home_'
```
This replaces com/index with org/home. The output shows the modifed URL:

Output
```
http://www.example.org/home.html
```
Do not forget the final delimiter, or sed will complain. If you ran this command:
```
echo "http://www.example.com/index.html" | sed 's_com/index_org/home'
```
You’d see this output:
```
Output
sed: -e expression #1, char 20: unterminated `s' command
```
Let’s create a new file to practice some substitutions. Execute the following command to create a new text file called song.txt:
```
echo "this is the song that never ends
yes, it goes on and on, my friend
some people started singing it
not knowing what it was
and they'll continue singing it forever
just because..." > song.txt
```
Выполните по-очереди три следующие комманды и сравните результаты:
```
sed 's/on/forward/' song.txt
```
```
sed 's/on/forward/g' song.txt
```
```
sed 's/on/forward/2' song.txt
```

You can then pass the p option to the substitute command to print lines where substitution took place.
```
sed -n 's/on/forward/2p' song.txt
```
Replacing and Referencing Matched Text
wildcard expression matches from the beginning of the line to the last instance of `at`.
```
sed 's/^.*at/REPLACED/' song.txt
```
you can use the & character to represent the matched text in the replacement string.
